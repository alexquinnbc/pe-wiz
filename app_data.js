The quality of your prompt heavily influences the quality of the AI's output.</p><div class="example"><p><strong>Simple Prompt:</strong> "Write a short story about a friendly robot."</p></div><p>It's the art and science of crafting inputs that guide LLMs to desired outputs.</p>`

            title: "Key Prompt Components",
            content: `
                <p>Effective prompts often include several components. You can practice with these in the 'Build' section:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Persona/Role:</strong> Define who the AI should act as (e.g., "You are a historian specializing in ancient Rome."). This sets the tone, style, and knowledge base.</li>
                    <li><strong>Instruction:</strong> The specific task for the AI (e.g., "Explain the fall of the Roman Empire."). Must be clear and unambiguous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context:</strong> Background information the AI needs (e.g., "Assume the audience has no prior knowledge.").</li>
                    <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> The specific text or question the instruction applies to. Can be part of the instruction or separate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples (Few-Shot):</strong> Show the AI the desired input/output format (1-5 examples). Crucial for complex or specific format tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output Format:</strong> Specify how you want the response (e.g., "in bullet points," "as a JSON object," "a single paragraph," "Markdown table").</li>
                </ul>`

            title: "Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting",
            content: `
                <p><strong>Zero-shot:</strong> Asking the AI to perform a task without any prior examples. It relies on its general training. Works well for tasks the model is already good at.</p>
                <div class="example"><p><strong>Zero-shot:</strong> "Translate 'hello world' to Spanish."</p></div>
                <p><strong>Few-shot:</strong> Providing 1-5 examples (shots) of the task to guide the AI. This helps the model understand nuanced requirements or specific output formats. Quality of examples is key.</p>
                <div class="example"><p><strong>Few-shot for sentiment analysis:</strong><br>Text: "I love this product!" Sentiment: Positive<br>Text: "This is terrible." Sentiment: Negative<br>Text: "The weather is okay." Sentiment: Neutral<br>Text: "This new phone is amazing!" Sentiment: ?</p></div>`

            content: `
                <p>Tools like Google AI Studio or Vertex AI Studio offer parameters to control generation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> (0.0-1.0+) Controls randomness. Lower (e.g., 0.2) = more deterministic, focused. Higher (e.g., 0.8) = more creative, diverse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Top-K:</strong> (1-N) The model considers only the 'K' most probable next tokens. Restricts choices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Top-P (Nucleus Sampling):</strong> (0.0-1.0) Selects from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds 'P'. More dynamic. (Use either Top-K or Top-P).</li>
                    <li><strong>Max Output Tokens:</strong> Limits response length.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop Sequences:</strong> Custom strings that, if generated, will stop the output. Useful for controlling format.</li>
                </ul>

                     <p>The key is to include "Let's think step by step" or similar instructions, or provide few-shot examples that demonstrate step-by-step thinking.</p>
                     <div class="example"><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?<br>
                     <strong>CoT Prompt Addition:</strong> "...Let's think step by step."<br>
                     <strong>Expected Model Reasoning (part of output):</strong> Roger started with 5 balls. He bought 2 cans, each with 3 balls, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 new balls. In total, he has 5 + 6 = 11 balls. The final answer is 11.
